# Book Recommender

## Data Sources
- **Main Dataset:** Sourced from the Goodreads database via Kaggle, providing extensive book information for our recommendation system.
- **2023 Best Books:** A list of top books for 2023, compiled through web scraping from the Goodreads website to ensure up-to-date recommendations.

## Description
- Search for books by title, author, or genre.
- Provide recommendations based on user queries.
- Interactive user prompts for detailed book information.
- Handling of non-matching queries with alternative suggestions.

## Components
- **find_book_by_title:** Searches and recommends books based on titles.
- **find_book_by_author:** Offers book recommendations by specific authors.
- **find_book_by_genre:** Recommends books within a selected genre.

## Project Approach
- **Web Scraping:** Possibly used for gathering book data from Goodreads websites(1000 list of best book of 2023)
- **API Wrappers:** Retrieves cover images of books using the Google Books API/ Generates summaries and insights about books using OpenAI's Chat GPT model.
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** Employed in the book recommender system, possibly for clustering similar books or analyzing user preferences.
- **Book Recommender Logic:** The core algorithm for suggesting books based on titles, authors, or genres.
